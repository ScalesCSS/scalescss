# Base Images for Scales

These are some simple styles for fixing images so they are a bit more responsive.

## Requirements

Scales patterns use the [Sass CSS preprocessor](http://sass-lang.com/), you'll need either Ruby Sass or LibSass.

## Installation

* [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install --save scales-base-images`

## Usage

There is no usage for this. It just adds some styles to images to make them scale with the viewport size unless a width or height are specified.
